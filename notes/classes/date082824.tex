\begin{gather}
max \text{ } {x_1 + x_2} \\
s.t. \text{ } 3x_1 + x_2 \leq 3 \\
x_1 \geq 0, x_2 \geq 0
\end{gather}

$x^*$ is an extreme point if we cannot find $x_1, x_2 \in S, $ such that $x_1 \neq x_2 $ and
$x^* = \lambda x_1 + (1-\lambda)x_2$ for some $\lambda \in (0,1)$
\\
For an n-dimensional problem, there are n-many constraints that are active/binding and their coefficients are linearly independent. 
\\
Optimal solutions can be found that are not basic feasible solutions when constraints and objective functions lie on the same plane.
