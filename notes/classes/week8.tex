\subsection{Radiotherapy example}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \min f(D) \\
    s.t. D = F(x) \\
    x \geq 0 \\
    \text{other dose constraints}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
D is the dose distribution, x is a vector beamlet intensities, some clinical criteria are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Target region should have 95\% of its bolume with 72 Gy or more
  \item Critical organ 1 should have the average less than or equal to 10 Gys
  \item The max of critical organ 2 should be less than or equal to 72 Gy
\end{itemize}
How can we model $D= F(x)$ while maintaining convexity? That constraint must be affine in order for the problem to still be a convex optimization problem. $F$ is a mapping from $\mathbb{R}^m \to \mathbb{R}^p$ where $m$ is the number of beamlet intensities and $p$ is the number of voxels in the human body. To preserve convexity, we can approximate the original problem with a linear formulation of the first contraint.
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \min f(D) \\
    s.t. Ax-ID \\
    x \geq 0 \\
    \text{other dose constraints}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Now modelling clinical constraints. We can define $C_2$ as the region of $D$ pertaining to critical organ 2 and same for critical organ 1:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \min f(D) \\
    s.t. Ax-ID \\
    x \geq 0 \\
    d_i \leq 72, i \in C_2 \\
    \frac{1}{|C_1|}\sum_{i \in C_1} d_i \leq 10 \\
    \text{other dose constraints}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Big M}
Can model a binary variable $z_i$ that is the indicator function of $d_i \geq 72$
